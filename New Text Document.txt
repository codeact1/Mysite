    <h2>Biography</h2>

    <p>My IT career started in <b>1999</b> after I graduated highschool, I went off to <i>Basic Training</i> for the United States Army. Back then the internet was pretty new and cellphones did'nt have GPS or cameras. After basic I attended <sup>Advance Individual Training</sup> at Fort Gordon, Ga where I was trained in Information Systems Analyst AKA <sub>Compter Technician</sub> . Back then dial up was still a thing.  
    Over 20 years <ins>later it's been interesting to see how IT has changed the world</ins>.  I remember researching things online in Highschool, now you can pay bills online, fill and file applications, and also go to school.  I started out doing Desktop and Network Support and now I'm leaning into the future with <mark> Application and Software Development.</mark>
